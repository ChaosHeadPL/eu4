As Bremen is a free city, it will be much harder if you declare directly on them directly (as the Emperor will defend free cities). Annex Bremen in a separate peace and release them as your vassal(you can't vassalize a free city in a peace deal). Afterwards consolidate power and grow large enough to combat your most powerful neighbours - Ottomans, Spain, France, etc. Make sure to give Bremen land as well, either in the direction of the Ottomans or in the direction of Spain. You will have to fight your way through one and feed Bremen provinces to \"snake\" Bremen's land down to Werder (This is because vassals need adjacent land or sea tiles to be given provinces and do not care about coring distance/colonial range).

Wait until tech 11. During this time, get exploration and expansion ideas as well as upgrading Athens so it is generating a profit of ducats as well as being able to afford level 1 advisors for admin and dip. Exiting and rejoining the game may result in the Ottoman deciding to give you subsidies as well. When you reach tech 11 you should have about 500 ducats and the 50% range bonus from exploration. You should try to reroll your dip advisor for the 20% colonizing range. From here you should save 220 dip so you can expel minority for your first colony in the Caribbean. It is recommended to only do 1 or 2 colonies until you can financially support all 3. After your first colony, try to prioritize colonizing the centers of trade and continue colonizing the Caribbean. You will want to make the Caribbean your center of trade. After all of the 8+ dev land is colonized start colonizing the US east coast. From here you are pretty much guaranteed to get the achievement, however if you wish to speed it up you can take Mexico / Peru to help speed up the process. Eventually, make the Chesapeake Bay your center for trade and transfer trade from other nodes to it.",

After Vinland forms, you can release and choose to play as them well within the time-frame of Denmark beginning integration, bypassing the PU. From there, expand and build as many manufactories as possible, swapping into canada or Quebec's ideas, or even the USA. An important thing to note is that you can have a 10+ development province after the start of the campaign, but NOT during the month you're trying to count highest income.\nGreat alternative start is Pomerania. Play regular HRE game, expanding into denmark and russia. Exploit all provinces within 10-20 development, boost development of all provinces below 10. Eventually your income from flat 10dev provinces will be the highest in the world, especially if you consider expanding into west and taking control over the Channel. Keep all high dev provinces like Lubeck under vassals.",
